## Introduction
Here is where we will be storing all our code to simulate the sensor data
generated in a pod run. All our software will be written in Python for now.
Reach out to Dival Banerjee in Slack if you have any questions or are interested.

## Good programming practices
In order to maintain organization over several years, we must follow good
programming habits. Developers at Google and Facebook are good at writing code,
not because of their intellect, but because of their good communication skills
with each other. For most of you, this is your first tine writing code for a large
project with multiple developers. Your code should be clear enough so that if you
did not look at it for 6 months, and began to work on it again, you'd be able to
understand it. I want all contributors to follow these guidelines when  writing
code.

- Limit line length, no line of code should be longer than 80 characters
- Use consistent names for variables, try to write out an entire word instead of
  abbreviating. For example,
    don't do this: imgfromfn();   
    do this: imageFromFileName;
- For variable and function names, capitalize the first letter of each word,
  except for the first word
- Use proper indentation
- Split your programs into multiple files and use folders
- Don't hardcode
- Validate method arguments with if tests
- Comment your code thoroughly as you write it, not after
- Don't add comments for obvious things

- Use github effectively(commits, pushing, pulling, branching, merging)
- Commit your code often
- Don't edit files that others are editing. If you want to, make a separate branch
